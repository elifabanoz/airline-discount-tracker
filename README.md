# airline-discount-tracker
Observer Pattern implementation, and uml's for airline discount notification system. Users (Regular, VIP, Gold) subscribe to airlines (THY, Lufthansa, Sunexpress) and receive notifications on discounts.  Software Engineering Project.

Case: 
Suppose you are required to write a web application to follow discounts in airway companies. There are
three companies registered to the system (such as THY, Lufthansa, and Sunexpress). Users of the
application are their potential customers. The users are classified into three categories: regular, VIP, and
Gold. The users can follow any of the companies in the application and are notified when there is a discount.
In the future, the application will be extended by adding new companies and users.
